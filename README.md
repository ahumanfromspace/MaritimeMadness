Hello!! Welcome to the README!!
This is by Myra, or ahumanfromspace, and this is my first proper python creation! Its not complete by any means at the moment (11/10/2024).
I hope to finish by December 2024.

Maritime Madness is a choose your own adventure game first started in July 2024, put aside for a bit, and now back to being made.
It centers around the protagonist, you, as you go through the research center and start uncovering its mysteries after being ressurected after drowning.
It involves: Sea Monsters, Romance, Mental Health themes, and some violence.
Be warned.

Haha anyways have fun with this wip!!
